# MalariaCNN
Malaria is a contagious disease transmitted through the bites of female mosquitoes. The parasite enters the blood and damages the red blood cells(RBCs). Symptoms may not show up for up to a year and causes respiratory complications and in some cases, can be fatal.
Traditional diagnosis of malaria includes health professionals reviewing the RBCs of patients. However, this is tedious, time-consuming and the accuracy is uncertain due to human error.
Our goal is to create a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model which reviews RBC images and predict if they are infected with malaria.
